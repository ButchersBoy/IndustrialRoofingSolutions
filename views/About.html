                                                <p class="p1">INDUSTRIAL ROOFING SOLUTIONS is a local roofing company with a vast amount of experience and knowledge in industrial roofing and cladding. Our team specialises in roof sheeting, cladding, flat roofs, liquid plastics, new build, repairs, roof light replacement, asbestos maintenance and removal, gutter repairs and maintenance, storm damage, emergency repairs and annual maintenance contracts. We also arrange plant hire, netting, steel erecting and scaffolding. We have been working ONLY on industrial roofs for 20 years.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">Over the years, IRS has also undertaken many over-clad projects which represent a cheaper alternative to replacing an old roof. With so much experience and expertise in this field, we are the most competitive firm on the market for clients who want to achieve a new roof over-clad to a high standard.</p>

                                                <p class="p1">IRS has an extensive client base and has undertaken many projects throughout the Midlands. Some of these include works for Birmingham Airport, Renault, Fiat, Kia, Harris Lamb, The National Health Service, Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council and Asda Stores Limited.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">We fully recognise the health and safety regulations and laws as they change year to year and our staff is constantly trained in safe working procedures. We understand the need to produce risk assessments and method statements prior to any works commencing. We are also fully insured against public liability, employers liability and contract works. All our operatives have the correct certification for the use of heavy plant such as scissor lifts, cherry pickers and all terrain tele-handlers. They have also all been trained in the removal of asbestos-contained roofing products, which allows us to strip your asbestos cement roof and have it removed from site by licensed carriage.  All this information can be found in our safety file or is available for immediate inspection.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">As part of our diligent service, we will complete free surveying and quotation, discussing with you the different types of systems which will best suit your project. We provide guarantees, a professional service and peace of mind. Call us today on <a href="tel:01216473731">0121 647 3731</a> to set up a consultation with an expert.</p>

                                                    <cite>IRS were by far the quickest to respond, turned out to be the most competitively priced and carried out the work in a safe, professonal and friendly manner.</cite>
